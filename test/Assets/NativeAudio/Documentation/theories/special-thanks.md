# Special thanks to the testers!

Would not be an Android development without the fear of something not working on some specific models or not. Luckily, I have got many friends and volunteers who are willing to spend their precious time to take the Native Audio performance test. For sure I expected Native Audio to work with every models being mostly on the native side, but still we cannot make an assumption like that in this chaotic world of Android.

This table serves as both an attribution to the testers and a coverage confirmation that a particular Android phone works with Native Audio. All models listed here has been confirmed that it does not drop from 60 FPS on a test scene which plays an audio repeatedly every frame. Thank you!
